# iVote-Simulator
In this program, a Java-based simulation tool is built based on live poll ideas (similar to Kahoot or Mentimeter). A question type (either single choice or multiple choice) is configured, along with student responses. The Voting Service accepts submissions from students - if there are multiple submissions from the same student, only the last submission is counted. Then, the Voting Service will output the statistics of the submission results.
